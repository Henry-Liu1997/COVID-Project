# COVID-19-Resource Project

As COVID-19 quarantine guidelines begin to relax and local businesses reopen, many New Yorkers are feeling comfortable enough to leave their homes. In order to keep our vulnerable neighbors safe and taken care of, our website will help residents locate the nearest Covid-19 testing sites, free meals locations, and a COVID-19 related picture to remind them of the current pandemic.

## User Story

As a New York Resident, I want to know where COVID-19 resources are available so that I can leave my home safely.

As a website user, I can type in my zipcode and select a button to see the nearest Testing Locations, Free Meals Locations, or both. Testing Locations will render as blue cards, Free meals will render as red cards.
